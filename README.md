# ModSenCom
This repository is added to provide simple code for Arduino Modbus communication.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Extract [LIB/ModbusRTUSlave.zip](https://github.com/syedmohiuddinzia/ModSenCom/blob/main/LIB/ModbusRTUSlave.zip) in Arduino Library folder.
3. Connect Arduino hardware using serial port and dpload [ModbusSlaveRTU.ino](https://github.com/syedmohiuddinzia/ModSenCom/blob/main/ModbusSlaveRTU.ino).
4. Extract [ModbusClientX.zip](https://github.com/syedmohiuddinzia/ModSenCom/blob/main/ModbusClientX.zip) and run ***ModbusClientX.exe*** in release directory.
5. Connect RS485 Sensor using RS485 to UART module as shown in the image below such that

    | RS485 Sensor | RS485  UART | Arduino MCU |
    |---------|-------|---------|
    | A       | A     |         |
    | B       | B     |         |
    | VCC     | VCC   | VCC     |
    | GND     | GND   | GND     |
    |         | RX    | RX      |
    |         | TX    | TX      |

6. Connect Modbus RTU with the RS485 Port and Sensor Baudrate *i.e. 9600*.
7. On next window of Modbus Client, change # of addresses to *4*, click on *Read from 0 to 3* and keep in mind that Slave Address *1* is slected.
8. Now data on specific holding registers can be read.
9. To write data on specific holding registers, double click and write a new value and then press enter.

## Diagram - (Modbus Holding Register)
| Address   | Variable              | Read/Write    |
| -------   | --------              | ----------    |
| 00        | Percentage Humidity   | Read          |
| 01        | Temperature           | (Read)        |
| 02        | Humidity Value        | (Read/Write)  |
| 03        | Temperature Value     | (Read/Write)  |
